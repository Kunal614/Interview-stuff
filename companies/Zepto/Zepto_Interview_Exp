Round 1: DSA (1 hr)

Started with little intro and some project discussions. Post that 2 questions were asked :

Given a matrix of dimension M * N where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:
0: Empty cell
1: Cells have fresh oranges
2: Cells have rotten oranges
Determine what is the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index (i,j ) can rot other fresh oranges which are its neighbours (up, down, left and right). If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.

Given an unsorted array arr[0..n-1] of size n, find the minimum length subarray arr[s..e] such that sorting this subarray makes the whole array sorted.
Example: If the input array is [10, 12, 20, 30, 25, 40, 32, 31, 35, 50, 60]
Result =[3, 8].
